        <p>I moved to USA in June 2014 from Hossana, Ethiopia and as everybody else fights a fight to win life.
            <br>I worked about four months and I decided to go school.
            <hr> After looking all the school chooses I have I decided to go<strong> MSU Denver </strong>for reseans. While I was attending school I was working part time (~30Hrs/Wk).
            <br>
            <br> There was a lot to take in. Things like
          <ul>
             <li>Culture</li>
            <li>Weather</li>
            <li>Food</li>
            <li>Transportation</li>
            <li> more.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <br>

            <strong>Adapting </strong> the School System and not having friends was also a big Challenge i used to face in the freshman year.
            <strong>I went through a lot and I made it at the End. </strong>
            <br> I believie these are the challenges which most of the imigrants and first generation faces in their live.
            <br>
            <br> But the <strong>Good news is there are many hero's which whom I looked up as good and role model in life</strong>

        <h4>How I see myself and the view i have</h4>
        <p>I believie in working hard until i get it right</p>
        it may be:
        <ul>
        <li>Learning</li>
        <li>Working</li>
        <li>Reading/Exercising</li>
        <li>AnyThing </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>After long Journey i graduated BSc in Computer Science and Math minor(F'19) and Currently I am on anther battle which is Going over Hunderds and hunderds of Applying for Job and interviews</p>
        <h4>God Bless You.</h4>
